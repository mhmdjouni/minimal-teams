# Minimal Teams

### A quite simplified, straightforward, and rather data-centric Jekyll website template

Minimal Teams is meant to be a minimal template for scientific or academic research groups or projects.
* Most of the content can be managed via the `_data/` folder.
* The `_config.yml` file is reduced only to the essential website or the plugins configuration.
* Any general, group-related, project-related, or team-related configuration and data are stored in the `_data/` folder.

Minimal Teams is partially inspired by Minima.
